Initially created from the ACPICA Git repository on 14 Jan 2012
using the following steps:

	$ cd ~/foo
	$ git clone git://github.com/otcshare/acpica.git
	$ cd acpica/generate/linux/patches
	$ ./acpisrc.sh  ~/foo/acpica/
	$ ./linuxize.sh ~/foo/acpica/
	$ mv new.linux ~/foo/syslinux/com32/acpioff/acpica_linuxized

Then the needed platform files were added, and a few problem files modified.
