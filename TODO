Currently scheduled for inclusion in 1.40:

- "Comboot" style boot files.
- Booting DOS for a DOS/Linux dual rescue disk.
- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.
- Boot ELKS, if at all possible (may have problems with i386
  assumption.)

For a later release, perhaps:

- Support for clusters larger than 16K.  This would require changing
  a lot of the SYSLINUX internals so we can read partial clusters;
  change the current "cluster pointers" to become
  "cluster:sector pointers".
