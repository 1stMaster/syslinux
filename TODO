*** To do in the short term:

- PXELINUX: Support changing the default server and downloading files
  from a non-default server.

- Allow the boot sector to be written to a file instead of the actual
  boot sector.

*** Debugging projects:

- Figure out why MEMDISK croaks on the WinME/WinXP DOS startup disk.


*** In progress, but for

*** Future projects:

- Clean up the command-line parsing.

- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.

- Major rewrite of SYSLINUX to support EBIOS/EDD, FAT32 and large
  clusters.  This should also enable code to be shared with the
  ext2/ext3 version.

- ext2/ext3 support (EXTLINUX.)

- Subdirectory support in SYSLINUX.

- Support files that span multiple input media (SYSLINUX)
  -> Seems to be getting less important; floppies are dying?

- Clean up the handling of sections

- Add "localboot" support to SYSLINUX (using the ISOLINUX feature
  set.)
  -> chain.c32 is probably sufficient.
