- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.
- Boot ELKS, if at all possible (may have problems with i386
  assumption.)
- Support for clusters larger than 16K.  This would require changing
  a lot of the SYSLINUX internals so we can read partial clusters;
  change the current "cluster pointers" to become
  "cluster:sector pointers".
