*** To do in the short term:

- PXELINUX: Support changing the default server and downloading files
  from a non-default server.

- MEMDISK: Support read only mode.


*** Debugging projects:

- Figure out why MEMDISK croaks on the WinME/WinXP DOS startup disk.


*** Future projects:

- Clean up the command-line parsing.

- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.

- Support for clusters larger than 16K.  This would require changing
  a lot of the SYSLINUX internals so we can read partial clusters;
  change the current "cluster pointers" to become
  "cluster:sector pointers".  (32K may be doable.)  Microsoft
  documentation claims that 32K is the maximum legal value although
  "some versions of some systems allow 64K".

- EBIOS support.

- FAT32 support.

- ext2/ext3 support.

- Subdirectory support in SYSLINUX.

- Support files that span multiple input media (SYSLINUX)
  -> Seems to be getting less important; floppies are dying?

- Clean up the handling of sections

- Add "localboot" support to SYSLINUX (using the ISOLINUX feature
  set.)
  -> chain.c32 is probably sufficient.
