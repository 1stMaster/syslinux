Please read the file syslinux.doc for information on how to use
SYSLINUX.

SYSLINUX now builds in a Linux environment, using nasm.  You need nasm
version 0.97 or later to build SYSLINUX from source.  See
http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm for information about nasm.

There is now a mailing list for SYSLINUX.  See the end of syslinux.doc
for details.

**** WARNING: READ THIS IF YOU'RE USING A 2.1.x EXPERIMENTAL KERNEL ****

WARNING: There seems to be a bug in some recent experimental Linux
kernels that causes floppy disk corruption when using the Linux
syslinux installer.  This bug exists in kernels 2.1.79-2.1.86; as far
as I know it was fixed in 2.1.87.
