Please read the file syslinux.doc for information on how to use
SYSLINUX.

SYSLINUX now builds in a Linux environment, using nasm.  You need nasm
version 0.97 or later to build SYSLINUX from source.  See
http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm for information about nasm.

WARNING: There seems to be a bug in some recent experimental Linux
kernels that causes floppy disk corruption when using the Linux
syslinux installer.  This bug was introduced in 2.1.79 or 2.1.80; as
of 2.1.85 the bug is still there.
