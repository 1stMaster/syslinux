Subject: [Etherboot-developers] WOL Routine

Attached is a WOL routine that can be used to wake a remote server from 
gpxe.  I put wol.c in src/usr and wol.h in src/include/usr.  This is really 
in improved replacement of that in contrib\wakeonlan\wakeserver.patch.  This 
version will no longer work since the eth_transmit routine no longer works 
with the newer driver arhitecture such as the e1000 driver.

Please consider adding it to gpxe preferrably in the main src directory or 
in the contrib directory.

Thank you
