          Text User Interface using comboot
          ---------------------------------

This is a menu system written by Murali Krishnan Ganapathy and ported
from OpenWatcom to gcc by HPA.

To configure the menus, you need to set up a menu configuration file
to have the menu items you desire, then build the menu system using
make.  You can use either simple.c or complex.c as a starting point
for your own menu configuration file; then add the name with a .com
extension to the MENUS list in the Makefile.

The resulting code runs both under DOS as well as SYSLINUX. A trivial
memory allocation routine is implemented, to reduce the memory footprint 
of this utility.

Currently, menu items, submenus and checkboxes are supported.

The keys used are:

* Arrow Keys, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End Keys
* Space to switch state of a checkbox
* Enter to choose the item
* Escape to exit from it

* The Watcom developers and Peter Anvin for figuring out the 
  startup code.
