          Text User Interface using comboot
          ---------------------------------

This is a menu system written by Murali Krishnan Ganapathy and ported
from OpenWatcom to gcc by HPA.

To configure the menus, you need to set up main.c to have the menu
items you desire, then build the menu system using make.  You can use
either simple.c or complex.c as a starting point for your own main.c.

The resulting code runs both under DOS as well as SYSLINUX.
Currently, menu items, submenus and checkboxes are supported.

The keys used are:

* Arrow Keys, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End Keys
* Space to switch state of a checkbox
* Enter to choose the item
* Escape to exit from it

Credits

* The Watcom developers and Peter Anvin for figuring out the 
  startup code.

P.S: I know that the choice of colors are not exactly the best
(in fact they are horrible). If you know a better choice of colors
I would be happy to change my defaults to your suggested ones.
