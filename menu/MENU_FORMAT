A .menu file can be used to describe basic menu structures which can be converted into 
C code which can then be compiled into a .c32 file for use with SYSLINUX. The format
of a .menu file is similar to an ini file, but with important differences.

COMMENTS and Blank lines
------------------------
Lines starting with # and ; are treated as comments. 
Blank lines are used to separate the attributes of one menu item
from another. Multiple blank lines are equivalent to a single one.
In other contexts Blank lines are not significant.

Menus
-----
Each menu declaration starts with a line containing the name of menu in [ ].
This name is used for internal purposes only and is not visible to the user of 
the system.

The menu declaration is followed by lines which set the attributes of the menu.
This is followed by a blank line and followed by declaration of menu items in 
that menu.

Currently supported menu attributes are
title: the title of this menu
row,col: position where menu should be displayed (defaults to system choosing optimal place)


Global Settings
---------------
All lines which occur before the first menu declaration is considered as 
a global declaration. Currently supported global settings are

title: the title of the whole menu system
top,left,bot,right: limits of the window in which menu system should use to display
     menu. Defaults to 1,1,23,78

Menu item
---------
Each menu item is declared by setting the following attributes

item: The string displayed to the user
info: Additional information displayed in the status bar
type: exitmenu,submenu or run indicating whether this item represents 
      an entry which exits this menu, goes to a sub menu or
      executes something in SYSLINUX
data: In case of exitmenu, this has no meaning
      In case of submenu, this is the name of the submenu
      In case of run, this is string to be passed to SYSLINUX for execution
