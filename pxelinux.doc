PXELINUX is a SYSLINUX derivative, for booting Linux off a network
server, using a network ROM conforming to the Intel PXE (Pre-Execution
Environment) specification.  PXELINUX is *not* a program that is
intended to be flashed or burned into a PROM on the network card; if
you want that, check out NILO (http://www.nilo.org/).  NILO can also
be used to create a PXE-compliant boot PROM for most network cards
which have drivers for Linux or FreeBSD.


    ++++ HOW TO CONFIGURE PXELINUX ++++

PXELINUX operates in many ways like SYSLINUX.  If you are not familiar
with SYSLINUX, read syslinux.doc first, since this documentation only
explains the differences.

On the TFTP server, create the directory "/tftpboot", and copy the
following files to it:

	pxelinux.0		- from the SYSLINUX distribution

	any kernel or initrd images you want to boot

Finally, create the directory "/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg".  The
configuration file (equivalent of syslinux.cfg -- see syslinux.doc for
the options here) will live in this directory.  Because more than one
system may be booted from the same server, the configuration file name
depends on the IP address of the booting machine.  PXELINUX will
search for its config file on the boot server in the following way:

  First, it will search for the config file using its own IP address
  in upper case hexadecimal, e.g. 192.0.2.91 -> C000025B
  (you can use the included progam "gethostip" to compute the
  hexadecimal IP address for any host.)

  If that file is not found, it will remove one hex digit and try
  again.  Ultimately, it will try looking for a file named "default"
  (in lower case).

  As an example, for 192.0.2.91, it will try C000025B, C000025,
  C00002, C0000, C000, C00, C0, C, and default, in that order.

It should be noted that all filename references are relative to the
directory pxelinux.0 lives in (usually /tftpboot).  PXELINUX
generally requires that filenames (including any relative path) are 31
characters or shorter in length.

PXELINUX does not support MTFTP, and I have no immediate plans of
doing so.  It is of course possible to use MTFTP for the initial boot,
if you have such a setup.  MTFTP server setup is beyond the scope of
this document.


    ++++ SOME NOTES ON THE TFTP SERVER ++++

PXELINUX currently requires that the boot server has a TFTP server
which supports the "tsize" TFTP option (RFC 1784/RFC 2349).  The
"tftp-hpa" TFTP server, which support options, is available at:

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp/
	ftp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/tftp/

... and on any kernel.org mirror (see http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/).

Another TFTP server which supports this is atftp by Jean-Pierre
Lefebvre:

	ftp://ftp.mamalinux.com/pub/atftp/

Unfortunately, the Intel LANDesk Service Agent II prior to version
0.99h (PXE PDK V2.4) seems to have a rather serious bug: it requests
the TFTP "blksize" option, but will be mortally confused if this
option is actually accepted by the server!  There are three possible
workarounds for this bug:

1. Use a TFTP server with doesn't support "blksize".

   Unfortunately, PXELINUX requires the "tsize" option to be
   supported, and it is very unusual for TFTP servers to implement one
   and not the other.  Both the tftp-hpa and atftp TFTP servers (see
   above) therefore can be configured to disable the blksize option.
   Use "-r blksize" for tftp-hpa, "--no-blksize" for atftp.

2. Use MTFTP for the initial bootstrap.  You need an MTFTP server with
   the appropriate DHCP setup to do this.

3. Use appropriate DHCP options that the client will attempt MTFTP
   before trying conventional TFTP.  It seems that the client will not
   request the "blksize" option if it has tried MTFTP and failed.
   These DHCP options are beyond the scope of this document.


    ++++ SETTING UP THE DHCP SERVER ++++

The PXE protocol uses a very complex set of extensions to DHCP or
BOOTP.  The best is probably to set up a "PXE boot server" on port
4011 of your TFTP server; a free PXE boot server is available at:

	http://www.kano.org.uk/projects/pxe/

With such a boot server defined, you should be able to use the
following DHCP set up, using ISC dhcp 2.0 dhcpd.conf syntax:

        allow booting;
        allow bootp;

	# PXE-specific configuration directives...

        option dhcp-class-identifier "PXEClient";
	next-server <pxe-boot-server>;

	# Standard configuration directives...

        option domain-name "<domain name>";
        option subnet-mask <subnet mask>;
        option broadcast-address <broadcast address>;
        option domain-name-servers <dns servers>;
        option routers <default router>;

	# Skip everything below if you want to use dynamic IP
	# address assignment
        host <hostname> {
                hardware ethernet <ethernet address>;
                fixed-address <hostname>;
        }


Some PXE implementations can be coaxed to operate with a normal DHCP
server; unfortunately so far no "magic bullet" which works with all
PXE implementations work.

The best one currently known, using ISC dhcp 2.0 dhcpd.conf syntax:

        allow booting;
        allow bootp;

	# PXE-specific configuration directives...

        filename "/tftpboot/pxelinux.0" ;
        option dhcp-class-identifier "PXEClient";
	option vendor-encapsulated-options 09:0f:80:00:0c:4e:65:74:77:6f:72:6b:20:62:6f:6f:74:0a:07:00:50:72:6f:6d:70:74:06:01:02:08:03:80:00:00:47:04:80:00:00:00:ff;
	next-server <TFTP-server>;
	# server-identifier <TFTP-server>;	# Illegal! See below

	# Standard configuration directives...
	# Same as above

However, some PXE implementations will only work this way if the
"dhcp-class-identifier" and "vendor-encapsulated-options" are *not*
present.  Intel Boot Client 3.0 and later are known to fall into this
category.  Arguably, that would have been the right thing from the
beginning.

Note that if your particular TFTP daemon runs under chroot (tftp-hpa
will do this if you specify the -s (secure) option; this is
recommended), you most likely should not include the /tftpboot prefix.

If the DHCP and TFTP servers are not on the same machine, you are
supposed to set up a PXE boot server (see above) on port 4011 on the
TFTP server; the "PXE boot server" is basically a modified DHCP server
on a nonstandard port.  If this is not possible, you can try adding
the directive "server-identifier <TFTP-server>;" Unfortunately this is
a violation of DHCP protocol, but some PXE implementations do not
accept the next-server directive without it or the "boot server".

I have successfully booted an Intel N440BX ("Nightshade") motherboard
with onboard Ethernet and "Intel LANDesk(R) Service Agent II version
0.99c" (derived from the Intel PXE PDK V2.0) and the Intel PRO/100+
Management Adapter "Boot agent 2.6 (build 071)" (derived from the
Intel PXE PDK V3.0 bld 071) using the configuration above and ISC
dhcpd 2.0.


    ++++ SOME NOTES ++++

If the boot fails, PXELINUX (unlike SYSLINUX) will not wait forever;
rather, if it has not received any input for approximately five
minutes after displaying an error message, it will reset the machine.
This allows an unattended machine to recover in case it had bad enough
luck of trying to boot at the same time the TFTP server goes down.


    ++++ PXELINUX IS STILL BETA ++++

PXELINUX is still very much beta; however, I'd be interested in
hearing about any experiences you might have with it, good or bad.  If
you have any comments, please use the SYSLINUX mailing list mentioned
at the end of syslinux.doc.  Thanks!

Currently known problems:

+ Requires a TFTP server which supports the "tsize" option.
+ The error recovery routine doesn't work quite right.  For right now,
  it just does a hard reset - seems good enough.
+ There may be funnies with memory management.  The PXE spec has no
  decent way of telling it to free up all memory and unchain any
  interrupts; it allows the base stack to be unloaded, but not the
  UNDI driver.
+ There seems to be a problem with sending ACK "storms"; a number of
  ACK packets fired off without the proper delay in between.  I
  suspect this is a PXE firmware problem, rather than a PXELINUX
  problem.
+ We should probably call the UDP receive function in the keyboard
  entry loop, so that we answer ARP requests.
+ Boot sectors don't work yet... they probably need auxilliary information
  (such as device) to work at all.
* No way to chain-load onto a hard disk.
