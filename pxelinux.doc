----------------------------------------------------------------------

PXELINUX is a SYSLINUX derivative, for booting Linux off a network
server, using a network ROM conforming to the Intel PXE (Pre-Execution
Environment) specification.  PXELINUX is *not* a program that is
intended to be flashed or burned into a PROM on the network card; if
you want that, check out NILO (http://www.nilo.org/).  NILO can also
be used to create a PXE-compliant boot PROM for most network cards
which have drivers for Linux or FreeBSD.


    ++++ HOW TO CONFIGURE PXELINUX ++++

PXELINUX operates in many ways like SYSLINUX.  If you are not familiar
with SYSLINUX, read syslinux.doc first, since this documentation only
explains the differences.

PXELINUX currently requires that the boot server has a TFTP server
which supports the "tsize" TFTP option (RFC 1784/RFC 2349).  The
source for such a TFTP server is available from the Netboot home page
at <http://www.han.de/~gero/netboot/english/download.html>.

On the TFTP server, create the directory "/tftpboot", and copy the
following files to it:

	pxelinux.bin		- from the SYSLINUX distribution

	any kernel or initrd images you want to boot

Finally, create the directory "/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg".  The
configuration file (equivalent of syslinux.cfg) will live in this
directory.  Because more than one system may be booted from the same
server, the configuration file name depends on the IP address of the
booting machine.  PXELINUX will search for its config file on the boot
server in the following way:

  First, it will search for the config file using its own IP address
  in upper case hexadecimal, e.g. 192.0.2.91 -> C000025B.

  If that file is not found, it will remove one hex digit and try
  again.  For 192.0.2.91, if C000025B is not found, it will try
  C000025, C00002, C0000, C000, C00, C0, and C in that order.

  Finally, it will try looking for a file named "default" (in lower
  case).

It should be noted that all filename references are relative to the
/tftpboot directory, or whatever directory the pxelinux.bin lives in.
PXELINUX generally requires that filenames are 31 characters or
shorter in length.

PXELINUX does not support MTFTP, and I have no immediate plans of
doing so.


    ++++ SETTING UP A BOOTP SERVER ++++

The PXE protocol is very complex, but I have successfully booted an
Intel Nightshade-based PXE host (with "Intel LANDesk(R) Service Agent
II"), using a DHCP-enabled BOOTP server with the following
configuration in /etc/bootptab:

<hostname>:hn:ht=ether:ha=<ethernet_address>:ip=<ip>:\
	:bf=/tftpboot/pxelinux.bin:\
	:T60=505845436c69656e74:\
	:T43=0603:\
	:T43=08000001ssssssss:\
	:sm=<netmask>:\
	:gw=<default_gateway>:\
	:ds=<dns_servers>:

... where "ssssssss" is the IP address of the boot server, in
hexadecimal.

Your mileage may vary.


    ++++ PXELINUX IS STILL BETA ++++

PXELINUX is still very much beta; however, I'd be interested in
hearing about any experiences you might have with it, good or bad.  If
you have any comments, please use the SYSLINUX mailing list mentioned
at the end of syslinux.doc.  Thanks!

Currently known problems:

+ Requires a TFTP server which supports the "tsize" option.
+ Probably doesn't work if the BOOTP/DHCP server and the TFTP server
  aren't the same.
+ The error recovery routine doesn't work quite right.
+ There may be funnies with memory management.  The PXE spec has no
  decent way of telling it to free up all memory and unchain any
  interrupts; it allows the base stack to be unloaded, but not the
  UNDI driver.
