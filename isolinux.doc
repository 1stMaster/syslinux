----------------------------------------------------------------------

ISOLINUX is a boot loader for Linux/i386 that operates off ISO 9660/El
Torito CD-ROMs in "no emulation" mode.  This avoids the need to create
an "emulation disk image" with limited space (for "floppy emulation")
or compatibility problems (for "hard disk emulation".)

This documentation isn't here yet, but here is enough that you should
be able to test it out:

Make sure you have a recent enough version of mkisofs.  I recommend
mkisofs 1.13 (distributed with cdrecord 1.9), but 1.12 might work as
well (not tested.)

To create an image, create a directory called "isolinux" underneath
the root directory of your ISO image master file tree.  Copy
isolinux.bin, a config file called "isolinux.cfg" (see syslinux.doc
for details on the configuration file), and all necessary files
(kernels, initrd, display files, etc.) into this directory, then use
the following command to create your ISO image (add additional options
as appropriate, such as -J or -R):

	mkisofs -o <isoimage> \
		-b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat \
		-no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table \
		<root-of-iso-tree>

ISOLINUX resolves pathnames the following way:

- A pathname consists of names separated by slashes, Unix-style.
- A leading / means it searches from the root directory; otherwise the
  search is from the isolinux directory (think of this as the "current
  directory".)
- . and .. in pathname searches are not supported.
- The maximum length of any pathname is 255 characters.

Note that ISOLINUX only uses the "plain" ISO 9660 filenames, i.e. it
does not support Rock Ridge or Joliet filenames.  It can still be used
on a disk which uses Rock Ridge and/or Joliet extensions, of course.
Under Linux, you can verify the plain filenames by mounting with the
"-o norock,nojoliet" option to the mount command.  Note, however, that
ISOLINUX does support "long" (level 2) ISO 9660 plain filenames, so if
compatibility with short-names-only operating systems like MS-DOS is
not an issue, you can use the "-l" or "-iso-level 2" option to mkisofs
to generate long (up to 31 characters) plain filenames.

ISOLINUX does not support discontiguous files, interleaved mode, or
logical block and sector sizes other than 2048.  This should normally
not be a problem.

ISOLINUX is by default built in two versions, one version with extra
debugging messages enabled.  If you are having problems with ISOLINUX,
I would greatly appreciate if you could try out the debugging version
(isolinux-debug.bin) and let me know what it reports.
